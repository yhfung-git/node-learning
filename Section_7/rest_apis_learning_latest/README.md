# NOTE
This corresponds to the initial react app made by Max for the the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/">NodeJS Course</a> by Academind by Maximilian Schwarzmuller, Maximilian Schwarzmuller.

I have updated the project to work with modern react components to a working state.

### The project uses VITE
#### If you don't know about how to setup VITE, you can check it out here

## The project MAY HAVE BUGS
I converted the project in 30ish minutes, THERE MAYBE BUGS : ) which didn't show up on the console immediately.
